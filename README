This fork represents my protest at VMware's attempt to usurp the name CloudFS,
which has been the public name for one of my own projects for well over a year
now.  Apparently they didn't even search for the name before attempting to use
it, or else they would have found that (at least) these organizations have a
better claim to the name than they do:

	Rackspace (abandoned name for CloudFiles)
	Cycle Computing (also abandoned?)
	Red Hat (my project)
	Oxygen Cloud (later, but registered a US trademark)
	Oracle (also later, new name for old cruft)

For what it's worth, VMware's "CloudFS" doesn't even seem to be a filesystem.
Their paper more accurately describes it as distributed block storage.  If you
look in the thoroughly misnamed "logfsPosix.c" you'll see a whole lot of
filesystem functions that haven't even been implemented, and many more that
don't even appear in their dispatch table.  Renaming it from Lithium to CloudFS
is therefore not only arrogant and anti-social but misleading as well.
